# OPDS Catalog Registry

This project is part of EDRLab's OPDS Interoperability Task Force.

For the time being, this will be a static list of catalogs containing:

- public libraries
- academic libraries
- school libraries
- specialized libraries
- public domain publications
- and open access publications

## 2026 and beyond

We'll move beyond a static list in 2026, turning this repository into a full fledged application where users will be able to:

- browse
- search
- or geolocate catalogs that are near them

## `opds://` callback
